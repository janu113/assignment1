3.INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM-
WE HAVE USED SOME BUILT IN FUNCTIONS IN C TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM.
REQUESTED TO HAVE THE BUILT IN PROGRAMS.
THE PROGRAM WAS RUN AND OUTPUT WAS OBTAINED ON CODEBLOCKS ITESELF.
ALL THE 6 STRINGS SHOULD BE GIVEN IN ORDER TO GET THE OUTPUT.

4.DETAILS ON EXAMPLE INVOCATION AND OUTPUT:
THE CONCEPT OF ANAGRAM WAS NOVEL.AFTER INDIVIDUAL TEAM NUMBERS SUPPORT THE CONCEPT WAS WELL IMPLIED AND THE OUTPUT WAS LIABLE FOR 6 STRINGS.

5.CHALLENGES FACED AND HOW DID WE ADDRESS THEM-
FIRSTLY,WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN ANAGRAM WAS BECAUSE WE DID NOT COME ACCROSS IT IN C LANGUAGE.
WHEN SIR EXPLAINED EACH PROGRAM IN THE CLASS WE PAID ATTENTION AND UNDERSTOOD THE EXACT MEANING OF IT.WE CAN SAY THIS WAS THE BASEMENT FOR OUR PROGRAM TO BE BUILT.
ONCE WE KNEW WHAT IT WAS,WE STARTED WORKING ON IT AND FOUND SEVERAL WEBSITES GIVING MORE EXAMPLES AND CODES TO IMPLEMENT IT.
BUT WE WERENT ABLE TO BUILD THE PROGRAM BECAUSE ALL THE CODES GIVEN WERE ONLY WORKING FOR 2 STRINGS.
LATER ONE OF US READ THE PROGRAM QUESTION AGAIN AND FOUND THAT IT WAS MENTIONED TO USE ANY INBUILT "SORT" TECHNIQUES.
HERE WAS OUR NEXT IDEA TO USE SORTING ON THE LETTERS.
WE WROTE A CODE WHICH WE WERE ALREADY FAMILIER WITH SORTING.
NEXT PROBLEM WAS ACCEPTING UNLIMITED STRINGS IN OUR PROGRAM.WE TRIED USING FILES CONCEPT AND ARRAYS.
BOTH DID NOT WORK WELL FOR US. AS THE NEXT STEP WAS COMPARING THE STRINGS, WE COULDNOT COMPARE THESE MANY STRINGS.
SO BY SEEING THE EXAMPLE GIVEN BY SIR AND DECIDED TO RESTRICT OURSELVES TO 6 STRINGS AND WE COULD COMPLETE THE CODE SUCESSFULLY.

6.WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THIS ASSIGNMENT:
EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THE EARMARKED CONCEPT
PROBLEM SOLVING
TEAM WORK
TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS HAVE SURPASSED.
